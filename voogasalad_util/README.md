# voogasalad_util

Shared code for VOOGASalad project.

You do not have permissions to push code directly to this repository.  
Instead you must create a Merge Request and have your code approved
before it is added as a utility.

Once your code is approved (either initially or when you add new features),
please notify the class to let them know about it so they have a chance to 
use your work.

To incorporate this repository into your project, I suggest using GIT's 
submodules (basically a way to embed another GIT repository within your 
own) rather than simply copying the code:
